Criteria are based on information from the BMK (Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie) and The Netherlands Nutrition Centre (https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/thema/kopen-koken-bewaren/eten-bewaren.aspx).\nCucumbers and bell peppers are often stored sub-optimally. They are stored in the fridge but it is best not to store them in the fridge. (https://www.bmk.gv.at/themen/klima_umwelt/abfall/abfallvermeidung/lebensmittel/tipps/lagerung/obst_gemuese.html)\nAccording to The Netherlands Nutrition Centre, courgette loses flavour in the fridge and is best stored outside it. Though BMK advises the fridge.\nMost other foods are stored correctly."

However, these are among the products which go off the least frequently."

Though it’s also not a very big deal.\nlettuce: very few people use the ‘stalk in water’ technique for storing their lettuce, which could be prolong the shelf life.\nanana: no one wraps the top in foil to stop the produced ethylene from spreading, which may affect the bananas themselves and surrounding products\nberries: they are somewhat more often thrown away and also packaged suboptimally. Airtight packaging and washing should be avoided. The moisture will make them go mouldy quicker.\nherbs: packaging varies a lot, the best being in a glass of water of wrapped in a moist towel. Though herbs are not bought very often."
