We distinguish five possible location:\n\nFridge\nFreezer\nKitchen counter\nPantry or kitchen cupboard\nCellar\n\nCriteria are based on information from the Austrian BMK, Gesundheit.gv.at and The Netherlands Nutrition Centre.\n\nCucumbers are often stored in the fridge. However, they are sensitive to cold and will only last up to 5 days in the fridge. They are best stored at 10-13 degrees, where they will last up to 3 weeks, but a cold place in the kitchen is still preferable over the fridge.\nApples are often stored on the kitchen counter. However, they are best kept between 2-7 degrees, in the fridge. This also makes it more likely they stay away from other fruits and vegetables which are sensitive to ethylene.\n\nTomatoes are missing from the list, but may also be tricky. They are best stored outside of the fridge.\nMost other foods are stored correctly and less important to focus an intervention on. Though it may still be worthwhile to inform consumers that bread freezer well, potatoes should go somewhere cool, dry and dark and bananas should not go in the fridge."
